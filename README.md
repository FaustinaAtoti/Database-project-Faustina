# Database-project-Faustina

 I installed Visual Studio Code and Node.js for this project.

 Used MySQL as my database system.
 
 In planning my database structure I used draw.io to drawan ERD to visualize my tables and relationships
I then created my database named food_db and created the tables in MySQL. The index.sql file contains queries used at this stage.

The next step was to connect my database to my application.But before that I had to populate my tables with sample data to test my setup and ensure that everything connects properly.

 In connecting our database to our application I did the following:
 
 
1.Run the following command to initalize the backend.

2.npm init -y.

3.Run the following command to install the necessary dependancies.

4.npm install express mysql2 nodemon cors dotenv ejs

5.Open .env file and add your workbench password (Save all changes).

6.Run this command node server.js

7.Search this on your browser http://localhost:3300/data
